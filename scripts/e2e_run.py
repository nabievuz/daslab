"""e2e_run.py — spec->build end-to-end run driver (R12 / DAS-1538).

The WS7 intake compiler (``scripts/gateway_compile.py``) and the six-gate checker
(``scripts/stage_gate.py``) already exist and are green, but nothing *drives* a
pack through delivery and no run-summary writer exists. This module is the missing
driver: it takes ONE Founder-approved **PROJECT-OS pack** and walks it end to end —

  1. **compile** — copy the pack into a scratch dir and run
     ``gateway_compile.run_pipeline`` to emit self-contained, stage-gated story
     tickets (asserting ZERO hand-written tickets — every board file is compiler
     output);
  2. **gate walk** — drive every stage ticket to ``done`` in AADL gate order
     (Stage 1 -> 6), confirming ``stage_gate.gate_order_violations`` and
     ``stage_gate.production_deploy_violations`` stay empty at every step (a
     stage-N ticket never advances past an open GATE-(N-1));
  3. **D-5 deploy (LOCAL)** — create the run workspace
     (``run_workspace.create_workspace``), stage the delivered board as the local
     artifact, run whatever tests the pack ships (if any) plus a health-check
     probe, and record *exactly* what was verified;
  4. **run-summary** — write ``board/runs/<run_id>/run-summary.md`` with the
     evidence JSON **inlined** in a fenced block, then gc the scratch workspace.

Nothing here re-implements compile or gate logic — it reuses the existing modules.
D-5 deployment semantics = LOCAL artifact (the delivered board staged in the run
workspace) + passing tests (if the pack ships any) + health-check evidence; NO
external infra, NO public push.

Under ``.gitignore``, only ``board/runs/*/run-summary.md`` is tracked
(``workspace/`` and any ``evidence.json`` are ignored), so the machine-readable
evidence is INLINED into ``run-summary.md`` rather than left in a separate file.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/e2e_run.py <pack_dir> [--run-id ID] [--runs-dir DIR] [--json]

Exit codes: 0 = run passed (PASS), 1 = run completed but failed a check (FAIL),
2 = usage / IO error.
