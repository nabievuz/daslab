"""resume_fork.py — Resume and time-travel fork for /daslab-cycle (DAS-1445).

Two operator affordances for crash-safe and alternative-plan recovery:

  --resume <run_id>
      Replay board/.events.jsonl for that run_id to the last valid checkpoint,
      then return only the UNFINISHED tickets (whose last recorded to_status is
      not a terminal done/blocked) for re-dispatch.  Refuses with ValueError if
      the replay chain is corrupted (T5 zero-corrupted guardrail).

  --fork <run_id>@wave-NNN
      Copy the checkpoint state at wave-NNN into a NEW run_id (ULID minted by
      generate_ulid); return the new run_id and the reconstructed ticket states.
      The original run's events in board/.events.jsonl are never modified —
      fork only produces a new run_id and state snapshot; the original run
      replays byte-for-byte unchanged after the fork.

SHADOW-RULE CONTRACT (ADR-0011 Phase-1 tension — read carefully):
  This module READS board/.events.jsonl to decide which tickets to re-dispatch.
  This tensions the Phase-1 "dispatch-decision scripts don't import dgox"
  structural guarantee; however, three mitigations keep the invariant honest:

    (a) Scope: this reader is scoped ONLY to the explicit operator-invoked
        --resume / --fork recovery path.  Normal wave dispatch (daslab-cycle
        step 3 selection + step 5 dispatch) is UNCHANGED — it never reads
        events.  The "flag-on == flag-off dispatch" guarantee holds for all
        normal invocations.

    (b) Import hygiene: this module does NOT import dgox.* directly.  Event
        reading is done via wave_kpi.read_events and replay_qa (neither
        imports dgox), so the ADR-0011 import-scan gate (P1 in
        test_dgox_phase1_shadow.py) is not tripped.  The only non-stdlib
        lazy imports are pulse_checkpoint (for completion records and ULID
        minting) and replay_qa (for group_runs + replay_run).

    (c) Failure isolation: a missing or corrupt event store surfaces as an
        empty unfinished set or a ValueError — it never silently dispatches
        wrong tickets.

  A formal ADR supersession is recommended to canonicalize "events are
  load-bearing for explicit operator-invoked recovery" (see DAS-1445 log
  and the comment in tests/test_dgox_phase1_shadow.py _EVENT_PRODUCERS).

Reuse contract (DAS-1445 §replay):
  group_runs and replay_run from replay_qa are the canonical transition model;
  get_completed_tickets and reconstruct_ticket_states from pulse_checkpoint are
  the canonical completion / state-reconstruction helpers.  This module does
  NOT re-implement run grouping or the ordered-transition walk.
