"""tests/test_cockpit_roundtrip_e2e.py — R7 cockpit interrupt round-trip + serve smoke.

Closes the two R7 coverage gaps the machinery had (all in scratch dirs, no live
board writes):

1. **Round-trip on a REAL card, <60s** — write a schema-conforming interrupt card,
   surface it through ``cockpit.panel_action_console`` (which advertises the <60s
   answer affordance + a copy-paste ``resume:<opt>`` stub), simulate the Founder
   answering by writing ``resume:<value>`` into the ticket body, and prove
   ``interrupt_roundtrip.detect_resumed_tickets`` resumes it with the right value +
   injection. The create→answer delta is measured and asserted < 60s.
2. **--serve smoke** — bind ``cockpit_html._make_handler`` on an EPHEMERAL loopback
   port, issue one GET, assert HTTP 200 and that the Action Console (with the card)
   is present. Previously the serve path had zero test coverage.
