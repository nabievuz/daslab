"""tests/test_dgox_phase1_shadow.py — DGO-X Phase-1 integration & shadow-clean acceptance.

GATE-4 acceptance suite: proves (a) the substrate works end-to-end and
(b) it is genuinely SHADOW — the Phase-1→Phase-2 gate.

The per-module unit suites (test_dgox_state.py: 53, test_dgox_events.py: 41,
test_dgox_board_adapter.py: 37 tests) already verify individual correctness.
THIS suite adds integration coverage and the three structural SHADOW-CLEAN proofs.

Why "flag-on == flag-off dispatch" holds for a skill-based shadow
-----------------------------------------------------------------
/daslab-cycle is a SKILL — a markdown document the orchestrator (Claude)
reads and follows. It has no feature flags in the runtime sense.  The
"shadow" is purely structural: step 5d is the ONLY place dgox.* is touched
inside the cycle skill, and it is positioned as:

  post-decision (after the routing choice is made)
  + observational (no return value read back into dispatch)
  + failure-isolated (any EventStore.append exception is caught + logged;
    dispatch continues unconditionally)

Therefore:

  flag-on  (step 5d runs)  → orchestrator emits routing_decision events
  flag-off (step 5d skipped) → orchestrator makes identical routing decisions

The diff between flag-on and flag-off execution is *exactly* the JSONL
lines appended to board/.events.jsonl — which is gitignored runtime state,
never read by the dispatch-DECISION logic.  The three proofs below make each
structural guarantee machine-checkable and executable.

SHADOW-CLEAN PROOF SUMMARY
───────────────────────────
P1 No-influence:  dgox.* is NOT imported anywhere in the dispatch-DECISION
                  path (the skill itself + the scripts it calls for selection/
                  routing).  The only dgox touchpoint is the post-decision
                  step 5d emission block.  Verified by AST import scan.

P2 No-writeback:  Running the full Phase-1 pipeline (build_mirror +
                  emit routing_decision for every ticket) mutates ZERO ticket
                  files in board/tickets/.  Byte-diff = empty.
                  Events land ONLY in the gitignored board/.events.jsonl
                  (tested with a tmp store, never the real one).

P3 Failure-isolation: An EventStore.append failure (simulated by monkeypatching)
                  is silently swallowed and does NOT propagate to the caller.
                  This mirrors step 5d's try/except-continue pattern, proving
                  that a broken event store can never block dispatch.

Together, P1+P2+P3 establish that DGO-X Phase-1 is a provably passive observer:
the dispatch decisions are byte-identical whether or not the shadow emission runs.

# SECTION 3 — SHADOW-CLEAN PROOF
# ===========================================================================


@_requires_board
class TestShadowClean:
    """SHADOW-CLEAN proofs P1, P2, P3.

    These three proofs together establish that /daslab-cycle dispatch decisions
    are provably unchanged whether or not the Phase-1 shadow emission (step 5d)
    runs.  See module docstring for the reasoning.

    WHY THIS CONSTITUTES "FLAG-ON == FLAG-OFF DISPATCH" FOR A SKILL-BASED SHADOW
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    /daslab-cycle is a SKILL.md — a markdown document followed by the
    orchestrator (Claude Code).  Unlike compiled code with feature flags, it has
    no runtime toggle.  The "shadow" guarantee is therefore STRUCTURAL:

    1. The dispatch-DECISION logic (step 3 selection, step 2 triage, routing)
       does NOT import or call anything in dgox.*.  P1 verifies this by AST scan.
       Therefore, adding or removing step 5d cannot affect which tickets are
       selected or which roles are assigned.

    2. Step 5d is positioned AFTER the routing decision and BEFORE subagent
       spawn.  It is purely observational: it calls EventStore.append, which
       writes to board/.events.jsonl (gitignored runtime state).  It never
       modifies a ticket file, never changes a status, never alters the agent
       prompt.  P2 verifies that no ticket file is mutated.

    3. Any exception inside step 5d is explicitly caught and logged; dispatch
       proceeds unconditionally.  P3 verifies this failure-isolation by simulating
       a broken store and confirming no exception escapes to the caller.

    Structural implication: removing step 5d from SKILL.md would leave all
    three decision paths (triage, selection, dispatch) byte-identical.  The
    only difference is the absence of lines in board/.events.jsonl — which
    the cycle skill explicitly states "NOTHING in /daslab-cycle reads or routes
    off" (step 5d, SHADOW / ADVISORY ONLY annotation).
